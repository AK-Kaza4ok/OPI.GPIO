# Orange-Pi-Zero-2-H616-Python
A modified version of Jeremie-C/OrangePi.GPIO library which is based on the original raspberry pi library. 
I added a class for the h616 Orange Pi Zero 2.  

The installation completes without errors. Example sketches run without errors, however, it doesn't work yet.  

GPIO.setboard(GPIO.H616) # Orange Pi Orange Pi Zero 2 board
